## Introduction to coding-growth mindset

### Growth mindset

To me, growth mindset is the ability to **LET** yourself learn. Often, we feel as though we can't learn. Either we are too old, not proficient enough, or the dreaded *IMPOSTER SYNDROME*. Growth mindset frees your mind from those doubts, and makes sure you know that you ***CAN***.

1. I will fight imposter syndrome any chance I get, I deserve to be here, and I can do anything I put my mind to. 

2. Remember that every person you idolize, started from the **BOTTOM**. 

3. I will always correct myself, instead of ~~can't~~, I CAN.
